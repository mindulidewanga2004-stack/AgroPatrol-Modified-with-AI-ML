# AgroPatrol-Modified-with-AI-ML
AI-Powered Animal Detection System for AgroPatrol Robot
Machine Learning | Computer Vision | Smart Agriculture
Developed an AI and Machine Learning–based image recognition system as an enhancement to the AgroPatrol Robot to improve farm security and crop protection. The system uses computer vision models to detect and identify different types of animals in real time from camera input captured in agricultural fields.
The detected animal type and related metadata are stored in a real-time database, and alerts are instantly delivered to farmers through a web application, enabling quick and informed responses to prevent crop damage. This solution transforms traditional farm monitoring into a data-driven, intelligent decision-making system.
The project involved image preprocessing, model training and evaluation, real-time inference, database integration, and web-based alerting, providing hands-on experience in building an end-to-end AI-powered IoT solution for real-world agricultural challenges.
